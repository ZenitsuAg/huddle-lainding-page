## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to work with responsive images, and it really helps to just set the width of the images to 100%.
This is the trick.

Example

```css
    img {width: 100%} 
```
Or you set the max-width to 100%, that way the image won't scale up more than its original size.

Example 

```css
    img {max-width: 100%}
```
